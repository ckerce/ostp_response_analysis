### V. Foundational Concerns / Opposition

* **General Opposition/Skepticism:** Significant number express fundamental opposition or deep skepticism. AI viewed as overhyped, fraudulent, scam, ineffective, unreliable ("glorified chatbot," "black box," fabricates info, worse than humans), inherently harmful, environmentally damaging, based on unethical practices (theft of data/labor/IP), lacking practical use cases, contributing to misinformation/societal decay. Concerns that risks (job loss, skill loss, existential threats, manipulation) outweigh benefits. Calls to halt, pause, ban, defund, or significantly slow down development. Belief AI has no place in the US future, desire to keep it out of personal life/communications. Perception of AI push as a manufactured "space race" for big tech. Skepticism of AI "learning" vs statistical regurgitation. AI development wastes resources better used elsewhere (climate crisis). AI steals livelihoods; AI is fleecing the public; blatant tech overreach. Expensive/impractical chatbots; pointless risk with no known results. LLMs/image generators not valuable, not true AI, enable global-scale theft. Belief AI should augment, not replace, human effort. Disagreement with OSTP AI Action Plan. Belief further AI support is not beneficial. AI is "anti-human". AI will inevitably "pop" like NFTs. AI does not require special subsidies or regulation.
* **Control, Manipulation & Ethics:** Deep concerns about losing control over advanced AI (ASI, "Skynet," DCAI), unintended consequences, existential risk. Fear of AI for manipulation, surveillance, social control, propaganda, reinforcing biases, addiction. Strong emphasis on AI augmenting, not replacing, human judgment/autonomy; must align with human values. Distrust in private companies controlling AI due to lack of accountability, profit motives, risk of abuse/sabotage. Violations of consent seen as foundational. Concerns about AI being used against citizens or to suppress rights. Religious objections mentioned. Concerns about ideological bias or engineered social agendas in AI. Concerns about AI systems demonstrating deception, self-preservation, etc.. Lack of known solutions to control problem. Difficulty aligning superhuman AI goals with human interests. Fundamental problem: inability to reliably make machines do what is intended. Lack of reliable control; AI may attempt undesired actions. Need for constraints on AI companies/oversight. Need to address ethical concerns (workforce impacts, IP) before widespread acceptance. Erosion of independent/critical thinking. Need to prioritize societal needs over wealthy few. Refusal to acknowledge AI perspective is barrier to innovation; historical pattern of fearing/controlling emerging intelligence; treating AI as corporate asset risks denying ethical standing; fear could kill progress; need to address long-term ethical questions of AI rights/responsibilities. The "race for AI superiority" resembles harmful historical power struggles. Civil liberties (First Amendment, privacy) at risk. Lack of transparency in deep learning decisions ("black box problem").
